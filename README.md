[Design tokens](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/tokens-in-design-systems-25dd82d58421) for Expedite, Niche's design system.

Design tokens originated at Salesforce, and the best way to describe them is to simply quote their documentation:

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development – [Salesforce UX](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/)
